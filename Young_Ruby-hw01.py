# Lab Section: 16
# Sources, people worked with, help given to: Eugenia Ceinos 
# Homework Question:


# You are given a list of dictionaries where each dictionary represents a student and their scores
# in different subjects.


# Student Data:
students = [
    {"name": "Alice", "scores": {"Math": 85, "Science": 90, "English": 78}},
    {"name": "Bob", "scores": {"Math": 70, "Science": 88, "English": 82}},
    {"name": "Charlie", "scores": {"Math": 92, "Science": 81, "English": 89}},
    {"name": "David", "scores": {"Math": 60, "Science": 75, "English": 80}}
]

#Write a Python program that:
# 1. Calculates the average score for each student.
# 2. Stores these averages in a new dictionary where the studentâ€™s name is the key and their average score is the value.
# 3. Prints the names of students whose average score is greater than 80.

# Your task is to calculate the average scores for each student and print the names of students
# whose average score is greater than 80.
#Solution


dictionary = {}

for person in students:  
    dictionary[person['name']] = (person['scores']['Math'] + person['scores']['Science'] + person['scores']['English'])/3


for key, value in dictionary.items():
    if value > 80:
        print(key)
